# CDC's glib

This is Cristi√°n Donoso's personal "go library", with common functions that I found are shared
between projects. Rather than re-implement them in every project, I have them in a common place.

These are mostly considered implementation detail and there is no real expectation that people are
to depend on this. Meaning that the API is not meant to be final either.
